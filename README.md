# Adam G√≥rski - MLOps Engineer / Data Scientist

I'm a machine learning operations engineer and researcher passionate about audio processing, computer vision, NLP, and recommender systems. Below are some of my featured projects:

---

## üéµ Audio Source Separation

**[agorski_sound_demixing](https://github.com/a-s-gorski/agorski_sound_demixing)**  
Explores various architectures, including segmentation models, GANs, and diffusion models, to improve music source separation on the MUSDB18 dataset. Provides an installable Python package with scripts for data downloading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference.

## üñºÔ∏è Computer Vision Segmentation

**[ENNCA-agorski](https://github.com/a-s-gorski/ENNCA-agorski)**  
Focuses on advancing computer vision techniques, particularly in image segmentation and feature extraction. Includes Jupyter notebooks and scripts leveraging PyTorch for data preprocessing, training, and model quantization. Explores neural network architectures like feedforward networks, BiFPN, and multimodal approaches for video and audio emotion recognition.
